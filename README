This uses Miso Dataset to get violations from a resource and show a CSV file you can use.To get running1.) Get Miso Dataset from http://misoproject.com/dataset/ and put it in js/lib2.) If your Sonar URL is different than what is in main.js, you will need to change it.To use1.) Go to the index.html2.) It will default to resource = 1 and get any child resources from that. 	You can specify your own resource by adding it as a parameter: dataset/index.html?resource=2

Note: Sonar's limit on the number of results for violations is 5000. You should be able to change that with adding "&limit=x" to the end of the call to the API but I have never gotten that to successfully work
